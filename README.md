* Sleep Cycles Alarm Clock
Have you had that disoriented feeling you get after waking up? You probably woke up in the middle of a Sleep Cycle. To put it simply, during a sleep cycle your brain goes through various patterns of activity. Typically, a person would have a sleep cycle every 90-120 minutes resulting in four to five cycles per sleep time. Tip: sleeping for a fewer hours, but waking up at the end of a sleep cycle make you feeling more rested, productive. 

* Stopwatch

* Timer
Just enter required time and hit start button. For games, sports, kitchen times, speaker's timer in presentations, debates. All you imagine.
